<h2>Victoria Sponge</h2>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<h4>For the sponge:</h4>
<ul>
<li>250 g unsalted butter, softened, plus extra for greasing</li>
<li>250 g golden caster sugar</li>
<li>4 large free-range eggs</li>
<li>250 g self-raising flour, sifted, plus extra for dusting</li>
<li>½ vanilla pod, split lengthways and seeds scraped out</li>
</ul>
<h4>For the filling and topping:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Zest of 1 lemon</li>
<li>1 tablespoon icing sugar, plus extra for dusting</li>
<li>100 ml double cream</li>
<li>4 tablespoons quality raspberry jam</li>
<li>100 g fresh raspberries</li>
</ul>
<h3>Method</h3>
<h4>Makes 10 slices</h4>
<br>Preheat your oven to 170°C/325°F/gas 3. Grease and line two 20cm sandwich tins, then lightly dust with flour.</br>
<br>Beat the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy – you can do this by hand, or in a food processor.</br>
<br>Add the eggs one at a time, making sure you beat each one in before adding the next.</br>
<br>Sift in the flour and fold through along with the vanilla seeds.</br>
<br>Divide the mixture between the prepared tins, using a spatula to spread it out to the edges.</br>
<br>Bake in the oven for around 45 minutes, or until lightly golden and beautifully risen. To check if it's done, poke a skewer or cocktail stick into the centre – if it comes out clean, it's ready.</br>
<br>Allow to cool slightly then carefully turn out on to a wire rack and leave to cool completely.</br>
<br>Finely grate the lemon zest into a bowl, add the icing sugar and cream and whip until it just starts to peak.</br>
<br>Spread an even layer of jam over one of the cakes, followed by a layer of the lemon cream, then dot the raspberries over the top.</br>
<br>Sandwich the second cake on top, dust with icing sugar, then serve.</br>
