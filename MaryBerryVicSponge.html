<h2>Victoria Sponge</h2>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<h4>For the sponge:</h4>
<ul>
<li>225g soft butter</li>
<li>225g caster sugar</li>
<li>225g self-raising flour</li>
<li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
<li>4 large eggs</li>
</ul>
<h4>For the filling and topping:</h4>
<ul>
<li>About 4 tbsp raspberry or strawberry jam</li>
<li>A little caster sugar</li>
</ul>
<h3>Method</h3>
<h4>Makes 6-8 slices</h4>
<br>Preheat the oven to 180°C/fan 170°C/gas mark 4. Cut 2 greaseproof paper circles, grease the sandwich tins with butter and put the circles inside. Grease the circles.<br>
<br>Place the butter in a large mixing bowl, then add the caster sugar, self-raising flour and baking powder. Crack the eggs one at a time and then add to the bowl.<br>
<br>Using the electric mixer on slow speed, beat for 2 minutes until smooth. The mixture will be soft enough to drop off the beaters when you lift them up.<br>
<br>Divide the mixture equally between the prepared tins and level the surfaces with a palette knife or spatula. Place in the oven and bake for 20-30 minutes.<br>
<br>The cakes are ready when they are risen and pale golden. The tops should spring back when lightly pressed. Cool for about 2 minutes; loosen the edges with a knife.<br>
<br>Push the cased out of the tins on their bases, invert them and remove the bases. Cool the cakes the right way up on a rack. Soften the jam with a palette knife.<br>
<br>When the cakes are cold, remove the lining papers and invert one cake layer onto a plate. Spread with jam, put the other layer on top and sprinkle with caster sugar.</br>
